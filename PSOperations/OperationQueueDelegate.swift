/**
 The delegate of an `OperationQueue` can respond to `Operation` lifecycle
 events by implementing these methods.
 
 In general, implementing `OperationQueueDelegate` is not necessary; you would
 want to use an `OperationObserver` instead. However, there are a couple of
 situations where using `OperationQueueDelegate` can lead to simpler code.
 For example, `GroupOperation` is the delegate of its own internal
 `OperationQueue` and uses it to manage dependencies.
